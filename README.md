## 🧠 What This Course Taught Me

This course provided a deep dive into working with structured data using Pandas, which is a key step in preparing data for any AI/ML model. Throughout the course, I practiced with real-world datasets and learned how to:

- Read and write data (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Filter, sort, and transform data
- Group and aggregate information
- Merge and join multiple datasets
- Apply custom and lambda functions
- Analyze time series data
- Integrate Pandas with NumPy and Matplotlib

## 🔍 Why Pandas Matters in AI

In any AI project, **data preprocessing and transformation** take up the majority of the effort. Pandas makes it easy to manipulate, clean, and explore data — all of which are crucial for building high-quality machine learning models. With this course, I now feel confident in handling and preparing data effectively for ML pipelines.
